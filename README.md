BaseCamp style framework for Laravel 5

``` BIG DISCLAIMER:
THIS IS MY FIRST LARAVEL PROJECT, THE FIRST WEBSITE I'VE BUILT IN 8 YEARS, AND I'M A CRAP DEVELOPER
```

This is a 'platform' for creating basecamp style websites and apps. It sits on top of Laravel 5, and controls the creation of organisations, users, and their conenctions. It does not give any of the actual Basecamp.com tool functionality, but allows for plugins/packages for tools to be created to sit on top of the platform.
